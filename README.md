These programs will be part of my utilities library. Providing some specific **file management services**

# file-extension-match_mover

To move matching files from whatever depth they are in a source directory, directly into depth level 1 of the destination directory.
Criteria to match (currently file extensions), source and destination directories are read from a configuration file.
TODO: List of all unique file extensions under the source directory is presented to the user for inspection. Based on this list, user can configure the program to 'extract' the files of interest into the destination directory.

# file-matcher-renamer

use to find files that match user specified criteria, then to rename those files in a way specified by user

# filename-space-remover

Linux doesn't like spaces in filenames. Neither do I, but they somehow seem to find their way into my filesystems.

Renames matching files in a specified directory, with space characters replaced by underscores. Able to exclude directories from search using configuration file.

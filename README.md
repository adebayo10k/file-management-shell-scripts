These programs will be part of my utilities library. Providing some specific **file management services**

# file_matcher_mover

To move matching files from whatever depth they are in a source directory, directly into depth level 1 of the destination directory.
Criteria to match, source and destination directories are read from a configuration file.

# file_matcher_renamer

use to find files that match user specified criteria, then to rename those files in a way specified by user

# filename_space_remover

Linux doesn't like spaces in filenames. Neither do I.

Renames matching files in a specified directory, with space characters replaced by underscores. Able to exclude directories from search using configuration file.
